name: Build Desktop Application

# This workflow automatically builds the desktop application for Windows, macOS, and Linux
# when changes are pushed to the main branch in the DeskTopApp directory.
#
# To enable code signing for production releases:
# 1. Add secrets in GitHub repository settings:
#    - CSC_LINK: Base64-encoded certificate file
#    - CSC_KEY_PASSWORD: Certificate password
# 2. Uncomment the env section in the build steps below
#
# For macOS signing, you'll also need:
# - APPLE_ID: Your Apple ID email
# - APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD: App-specific password
# - APPLE_TEAM_ID: Your Apple Developer Team ID
