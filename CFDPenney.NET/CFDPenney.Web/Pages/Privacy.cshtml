        <h3>4.1 Peer-to-Peer Architecture</h3>
        <p>CFD Penney uses a peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture powered by WebRTC:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your data is transmitted directly between participants, not through our servers</li>
            <li>We only facilitate the initial connection between peers</li>
            <li>Once connected, all data flows directly between participants</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4.2 Local Storage</h3>
        <p>CFD Penney may use browser local storage to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Remember your preferences (theme settings, tool selections)</li>

            <li>Store drawings locally if you choose to work offline</li>
            <li>Remember your device preferences (camera, microphone, speaker selections)</li>
            <li>Store chat message history temporarily during an active session (cleared when session ends)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This data never leaves your device unless you explicitly share it in a collaboration session.</p>

        <h3>4.3 Security Measures</h3>
